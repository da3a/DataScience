Hey BIC!
 
Tomorrow morning we are going to be revealing exclusive holiday collections and gifts LIVE from our New York City press event. I'll be onsite and answering your product questions in real time so get ready!  
 
The event will take place from 8-10 am ET (5-7 am PT). West Coasters, we know this may be early for you but if you have questions the best time to ask will be when I have access to the product on the front lines! If you miss the live event, the thread will stay open in Conversations and we will do our best to answer any follow-up questions.
 
What brands are you most excited to see? Tell us below!

I am excited for Tarte Cosmetic Holiday collection!



Yes!❤️❤️❤️    



Cant wait to see the rest of the pics! 



			
				
					
						Definitely eyeing the lipsticks for nars, bite, and ysl
					
				
			
			
				
			
			
				


			
				
					
						So excited for the holiday collection 😍
					
				
			
			
				
			
			
				


I can't wait to see the new items for Christmas.  When will we be able to see it online?



			
				
					
						I would like to hear about products designed for treatment of the delicate skin around the eye, which will actually lift and renew the skin. On vacation in Beverly Hills I was given a sample of a new formula from a "more advanced" company, which I have not been able to find again; based on plant stem cell therapy, that actually worked. No it was not glue. Sufficient samples were given to me for about 4-5 weeks, and if combined with their serum, were incredible. Now, I am 2 years older, tried various other products, even returned to Beverly Hills, but the spa had relocated. What is a desperate Missouri girl to do?
					
				
			
			
				
			
			
				


			
				
					
						Belif true moisture bomb is the best moisturizer in the world in my opinion. I'm in Canada so I can only get it at the face shop, but if you're in the states, you can get it at Sephora. It is really amazing stuff!
					
				
			
			
				
			
			
				


			
				
					
						I'm so sorry if this has already been asked and answered, but are these products going to be up online at the same time as the Rouge Preview event? For those who can't physically go to stores? Thanks!
					
				
			
			
				
			
			
				


			
				
					
						Can't get enough of good skincare, especially Sunday Riley! Good Genes and Luna brought life back to my skin. Always on the hunt for hydrating moisturizers, essences, and toners for my parched skin. Any suggestions???
					
				
			
			
				
			
			
				


			
				
					
						The Dr. Jart water fuse is great
					
				
			
			
				
			
			
				


man, I am so excited for the holidays now  what wonderful gift sets!!

						So excited for Holiday this year! So glad I was able to see some of the goodies today as well!

						Can't get enough of good skincare, especially Sunday Riley! Good Genes and Luna brought life back to my skin. Always on the hunt for hydrating moisturizers, essences, and toners for my parched skin. Any suggestions???

I am excited for Tarte Cosmetic Holiday collection!



Yes!❤️❤️❤️    



Cant wait to see the rest of the pics! 



			
				
					
						Definitely eyeing the lipsticks for nars, bite, and ysl
					
				
			
			
				
			
			
				


			
				
					
						So excited for the holiday collection 😍
					
				
			
			
				
			
			
				


I can't wait to see the new items for Christmas.  When will we be able to see it online?



			
				
					
						I would like to hear about products designed for treatment of the delicate skin around the eye, which will actually lift and renew the skin. On vacation in Beverly Hills I was given a sample of a new formula from a "more advanced" company, which I have not been able to find again; based on plant stem cell therapy, that actually worked. No it was not glue. Sufficient samples were given to me for about 4-5 weeks, and if combined with their serum, were incredible. Now, I am 2 years older, tried various other products, even returned to Beverly Hills, but the spa had relocated. What is a desperate Missouri girl to do?
					
				
			
			
				
			
			
				


			
				
					
						Belif true moisture bomb is the best moisturizer in the world in my opinion. I'm in Canada so I can only get it at the face shop, but if you're in the states, you can get it at Sephora. It is really amazing stuff!
					
				
			
			
				
			
			
				


			
				
					
						I'm so sorry if this has already been asked and answered, but are these products going to be up online at the same time as the Rouge Preview event? For those who can't physically go to stores? Thanks!
					
				
			
			
				
			
			
				


			
				
					
						Can't get enough of good skincare, especially Sunday Riley! Good Genes and Luna brought life back to my skin. Always on the hunt for hydrating moisturizers, essences, and toners for my parched skin. Any suggestions???
					
				
			
			
				
			
			
				


			
				
					
						The Dr. Jart water fuse is great
					
				
			
			
				
			
			
				


man, I am so excited for the holidays now  what wonderful gift sets!!

it seems dark enough for everyday wear.

Hey BIC!
 
Tomorrow morning we are going to be revealing exclusive holiday collections and gifts LIVE from our New York City press event. I'll be onsite and answering your product questions in real time so get ready!  
 
The event will take place from 8-10 am ET (5-7 am PT). West Coasters, we know this may be early for you but if you have questions the best time to ask will be when I have access to the product on the front lines! If you miss the live event, the thread will stay open in Conversations and we will do our best to answer any follow-up questions.
 
What brands are you most excited to see? Tell us below!

I can't wait to see the new items for Christmas.  When will we be able to see it online?



			
				
					
						I would like to hear about products designed for treatment of the delicate skin around the eye, which will actually lift and renew the skin. On vacation in Beverly Hills I was given a sample of a new formula from a "more advanced" company, which I have not been able to find again; based on plant stem cell therapy, that actually worked. No it was not glue. Sufficient samples were given to me for about 4-5 weeks, and if combined with their serum, were incredible. Now, I am 2 years older, tried various other products, even returned to Beverly Hills, but the spa had relocated. What is a desperate Missouri girl to do?
					
				
			
			
				
			
			
				


			
				
					
						Belif true moisture bomb is the best moisturizer in the world in my opinion. I'm in Canada so I can only get it at the face shop, but if you're in the states, you can get it at Sephora. It is really amazing stuff!
					
				
			
			
				
			
			
				


			
				
					
						I'm so sorry if this has already been asked and answered, but are these products going to be up online at the same time as the Rouge Preview event? For those who can't physically go to stores? Thanks!
					
				
			
			
				
			
			
				


			
				
					
						Can't get enough of good skincare, especially Sunday Riley! Good Genes and Luna brought life back to my skin. Always on the hunt for hydrating moisturizers, essences, and toners for my parched skin. Any suggestions???

I can't wait to see the new items for Christmas.  When will we be able to see it online?



			
				
					
						I would like to hear about products designed for treatment of the delicate skin around the eye, which will actually lift and renew the skin. On vacation in Beverly Hills I was given a sample of a new formula from a "more advanced" company, which I have not been able to find again; based on plant stem cell therapy, that actually worked. No it was not glue. Sufficient samples were given to me for about 4-5 weeks, and if combined with their serum, were incredible. Now, I am 2 years older, tried various other products, even returned to Beverly Hills, but the spa had relocated. What is a desperate Missouri girl to do?

I can't wait to see the new items for Christmas.  When will we be able to see it online?



			
				
					
						I would like to hear about products designed for treatment of the delicate skin around the eye, which will actually lift and renew the skin. On vacation in Beverly Hills I was given a sample of a new formula from a "more advanced" company, which I have not been able to find again; based on plant stem cell therapy, that actually worked. No it was not glue. Sufficient samples were given to me for about 4-5 weeks, and if combined with their serum, were incredible. Now, I am 2 years older, tried various other products, even returned to Beverly Hills, but the spa had relocated. What is a desperate Missouri girl to do?

					I am also on the becca opal recommendation bandwagon. It's not the best
shade for fair skin but for medium skin it's perfect. Champagne pop is
more golden so if you don't have yellow undertones it's not going to
look as flattering. @Amy1203

						I would like to hear about products designed for treatment of the delicate skin around the eye, which will actually lift and renew the skin. On vacation in Beverly Hills I was given a sample of a new formula from a "more advanced" company, which I have not been able to find again; based on plant stem cell therapy, that actually worked. No it was not glue. Sufficient samples were given to me for about 4-5 weeks, and if combined with their serum, were incredible. Now, I am 2 years older, tried various other products, even returned to Beverly Hills, but the spa had relocated. What is a desperate Missouri girl to do?

I can't wait to see the new items for Christmas.  When will we be able to see it online?



			
				
					
						I would like to hear about products designed for treatment of the delicate skin around the eye, which will actually lift and renew the skin. On vacation in Beverly Hills I was given a sample of a new formula from a "more advanced" company, which I have not been able to find again; based on plant stem cell therapy, that actually worked. No it was not glue. Sufficient samples were given to me for about 4-5 weeks, and if combined with their serum, were incredible. Now, I am 2 years older, tried various other products, even returned to Beverly Hills, but the spa had relocated. What is a desperate Missouri girl to do?
					
				
			
			
				
			
			
				


			
				
					
						Belif true moisture bomb is the best moisturizer in the world in my opinion. I'm in Canada so I can only get it at the face shop, but if you're in the states, you can get it at Sephora. It is really amazing stuff!
					
				
			
			
				
			
			
				


			
				
					
						I'm so sorry if this has already been asked and answered, but are these products going to be up online at the same time as the Rouge Preview event? For those who can't physically go to stores? Thanks!
					
				
			
			
				
			
			
				


			
				
					
						Can't get enough of good skincare, especially Sunday Riley! Good Genes and Luna brought life back to my skin. Always on the hunt for hydrating moisturizers, essences, and toners for my parched skin. Any suggestions???

I can't wait to see the new items for Christmas.  When will we be able to see it online?



			
				
					
						I would like to hear about products designed for treatment of the delicate skin around the eye, which will actually lift and renew the skin. On vacation in Beverly Hills I was given a sample of a new formula from a "more advanced" company, which I have not been able to find again; based on plant stem cell therapy, that actually worked. No it was not glue. Sufficient samples were given to me for about 4-5 weeks, and if combined with their serum, were incredible. Now, I am 2 years older, tried various other products, even returned to Beverly Hills, but the spa had relocated. What is a desperate Missouri girl to do?
					
				
			
			
				
			
			
				


			
				
					
						Belif true moisture bomb is the best moisturizer in the world in my opinion. I'm in Canada so I can only get it at the face shop, but if you're in the states, you can get it at Sephora. It is really amazing stuff!
					
				
			
			
				
			
			
				


			
				
					
						I'm so sorry if this has already been asked and answered, but are these products going to be up online at the same time as the Rouge Preview event? For those who can't physically go to stores? Thanks!
					
				
			
			
				
			
			
				


			
				
					
						Can't get enough of good skincare, especially Sunday Riley! Good Genes and Luna brought life back to my skin. Always on the hunt for hydrating moisturizers, essences, and toners for my parched skin. Any suggestions???

it seems dark enough for everyday wear.

					I am also on the becca opal recommendation bandwagon. It's not the best
shade for fair skin but for medium skin it's perfect. Champagne pop is
more golden so if you don't have yellow undertones it's not going to

I can't wait to see the new items for Christmas.  When will we be able to see it online?



			
				
					
						I would like to hear about products designed for treatment of the delicate skin around the eye, which will actually lift and renew the skin. On vacation in Beverly Hills I was given a sample of a new formula from a "more advanced" company, which I have not been able to find again; based on plant stem cell therapy, that actually worked. No it was not glue. Sufficient samples were given to me for about 4-5 weeks, and if combined with their serum, were incredible. Now, I am 2 years older, tried various other products, even returned to Beverly Hills, but the spa had relocated. What is a desperate Missouri girl to do?

likes it and does it. Wiggly brows!! Someone started something and some

I can't wait to see the new items for Christmas.  When will we be able to see it online?



			
				
					
						I would like to hear about products designed for treatment of the delicate skin around the eye, which will actually lift and renew the skin. On vacation in Beverly Hills I was given a sample of a new formula from a "more advanced" company, which I have not been able to find again; based on plant stem cell therapy, that actually worked. No it was not glue. Sufficient samples were given to me for about 4-5 weeks, and if combined with their serum, were incredible. Now, I am 2 years older, tried various other products, even returned to Beverly Hills, but the spa had relocated. What is a desperate Missouri girl to do?
					
				
			
			
				
			
			
				


			
				
					
						Belif true moisture bomb is the best moisturizer in the world in my opinion. I'm in Canada so I can only get it at the face shop, but if you're in the states, you can get it at Sephora. It is really amazing stuff!

					I've wanted this palette since it came out. Have any of you bought it?
If so thoughts? Is it as worth it as so many people say it is or is it
just too hyped up?
			


Reply:
					I genuinely think its worth every penny (although morphe shipping is
kinda ridiculous if ur not American lol) the quality is great, it's
pigmented, it's not blotchy, and it blends. It has a lot of warm tones
so if you're into that, you'll be set.
			


					I would love to have recommendations on foundations that have good
coverage but doesn't look cakey and unnatural? Thank you!!
			


Reply:
					Definitely the Smashbox Hydrating Foundation, medium to buildable full
coverage. or the Clinique Even Better Makeup, medium, Dewey foundation.
			


					I would love to hear about your thoughts on the Urban Decay Naked Heat
palette. Do you love it? Hate it? Have another palette you feel does the

					The pallet is fantastic. The pigment is great and it takes very little
to get a great Smokey sunset effect. I also purchased on of the new
eyeliners that go with the heat pallet. I got alkaline.
