							edensong what oil would you recommend for helping the scalp/ thinning hair issues???  I have heard about Neem, but wondered what you would recommend. Being the oil guru-reply: 
							Andiroba has similar properties to that of Neem oil but *without* the characteristic unfriendly scent.  Avocado, babassu, camellia, castor, coconut, grapeseed, jojoba, and hempseed are suppose to help stimulate hair growth.  Virtually all the oils are good for moisturizing and strengthening the hair shafts.
I've read that Sapote Seed oil and Brahmi oil help with hair loss, but I've not used them.

Darn and I saw Brahmi oil today when I was out and about.  I just might have to go get that tomorrow and try it as well.  I have been applying Skinactives Hair serum but also wanted to try a few oils and see how I do with them.  
The Skinactives product is nice, it just makes my hair SUPER crusty and I can't stand it.  I only apply it at night when my hair is wet, but still, it makes my head almost stick to my pillow case-  when I wake in the AM  Mr Gymrat goes-reply: 
							I don't know what's in their hair serum, so I'm unsure why it leaves your hair crusty.
You can use the oils lightly, like a leave in conditioner or in a heavier application, similar to a hot oil treatment.  It won't happen overnight, though, so give it time.

I exfoliate daily, every other day, just depends on how my skin feels.  Use it 2-3 days a week if you wish too.  Its your skin, so do what works for you.  Theres no one way to exfoliating, depends on what your trying to accomplish. 
Recommended use for Amlactin (which is a great exfoliant) which contains 12% lactic acid is twice a day, so using a sugar scrub daily is no harm, trust me.

						 reply: 
							Manly, you'll need to use a salicylic acid exfoliator to penetrate through the oil and into the pores.  You could either use 2% on a daily basis or use a higher percentage (5% - 10% depending on how sensitive your skin is) as a chemical peel every week or so.  Makeupartistschoice.com has the chemical peels.  This should help you a lot.(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8275654454018663,size:[0, 0],id:"ld-9709-7603"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src="//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,"script","ld-ajs");

							Here is another option simple and easy to use.  Works great at cleaning out the pores. 
-Four or five aspirin. They must be uncoated, plain aspirin- Advil, Aleve,  Tylenol, and the like won't work. 
-A tablespoon or two of lukewarm water
-Honey or plain yogurt (optional)
Mix the aspirin with just enough water to make a paste. If you want a thicker mask, add a dollop of honey.  If you prefer a more soothing mask or have sensitive skin, some plain yogurt can do the trick.  Apply the mask in a thin layer on your face, allow it to dry.  Remove it by rubbing in gentle circular motions.
You can also just spot treat with this.  So if the nose area is the issue for you, you can just apply it there.

What you could do is use this along with your cleanser and it gives a nice exfoliation.   http://www.amazon.com/NCN-Pro-Skincare-Microfiber-Cleansing/dp/B00FSBNGKM   Or, you can use chemicals, a mild one is mandalic acid, a little stronger is lactic acid.  Both are great for exfoliating. http://www.makeupartistschoice.com/Mandelic-Acid-_c_89.html http://www.makeupartistschoice.com/40-Lactic-Acid-Kits_p_32.html  Vit C serum is also a good way for a little exfoliation.

  What do you cleanse your face with?? Soap??  Any basic cleanser works.  Cetaphil, CeraVe, these are basic, decent cleansers.  If you have acne/oily clean then I would say use a cleanser that contains 2% salicylic acid.  Biore, Clearasil, Phisoderm Anti Blemish, any of these are good and sold over the counter.

  If you only cleanse once a day, I would make it a habit to do this in the PM.  In the AM splash with water.  In the PM use a cleanser in order to remove all the days gunk that you have on your skin.  So what I do is put a few pumps of cleanser on the cloth and use that way.  BE gentle in the beginning as it will exfoliate extremely well until you figure out the best pressure to use.  The cloth is powerful so do not scrub or use like you would a washcloth.  It will get your face and pore very clean!!

							Try using a cleanser with 2% Salicylic Acid, there are several over the counter ones you can try that contain 2%.  Biore, Clearasil, are a few brands that come to mind.  Just read the ingredient listing on the back and be sure it contains 2% SA.  The other thing is don't pick, try keeping your hands away from your face as much as you can and also, changing your pillow case a few times a week is crucial.  You can also apply this peel below, once a week, and it will help even more!!  Mandalic Acid is great for acne prone.   Apply once a week, and rinse off with soap and water is all it takes!!http://www.makeupartistschoice.com/2...Peel_p_26.html

Shaving however you can use with caution like gymrat said you can try oils I've seen a couple videos on YOUTUBE people have been using baby oil
Also for areas (intimate area e.g. inner thighs) Femfresh Shaving Cream (In UK and AUS I believe not sure about AUS) is really excellent and I have used, still using it is really gentle with loads of oils.
You can also try laser (which i currently am) which  is helpful to reduce having to remove hair (as I am pretty hairy)

Thank you for the reply,  yemeve .
Is the lemon oil the best one for my specific goal?
I have checked creams and specific products for the lightning part, but they often include chemicals and such, and id rather do it the natural way. Wouldn't want to put too much chemicals down there.
Therefor I ordered a 100% organic lemon oil to try.
Do you think it would work by putting the lemon oil on first, than the shea and coco a few minutes after? Or put it on all together at the same time?
Ive read that shea butter helps with skin lightning slightly, but most importantly healing and making the skin smoother and repaired.

							Hi, i'm a guy in my late 20s. I've never really moisturised or had any sort of routine. I've briefly looked into serums etc but never really got anywhere.
Is it a mistake to not moisturise and clean your face daily?
There are so many products out there (and many fake review on amazon) that I'm not sure what to get or where to start.
What's the best thing I can do for my skin to keep it healthy and reduce ageing?
Thanks in advance for any help/guidance.
						 reply: 
							Hi there! 
The BEST thing you can do for your skin and reduce  aging is to wear sunscreen every time you're out, no matter what the  weather.  Zinc is the best and we have a great list:  http://www.skincaretalk.com/showthre...Sunscreen-List
You  should cleanse and moisturize your face daily. You should also  exfoliate but that the frequency varies on your skin type and desired  results. We are shedding all the time and buildup causes dull skin,  pimples, etc so everything should at least be done on a consistent  basis. 
First you have to figure out if your skin is dry, oily, combo? Blemishes? Etc, etc. (function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8275654454018663,size:[0, 0],id:"ld-9709-7603"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src="//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,"script","ld-ajs");

							GoldistheWay has great advice for you!
Assuming that you are new to skin care your best bet is to take it slow. Ease yourself into it. Start with a good cleanser, moisturizer and sunscreen. Keep it simple and go from there. Great skin isn't hard to achieve. The hardest part about having great skin is to keep the regimen going and not skimping on your routine. It takes true determination to do this. Therefore, start small and build your way into it.
Hope this helps! :-)

							Hey everyone. 
I bought a bottle of 40% lactic Acid. Specifically this brand ASDM Beverly Hills 40% Lactic Acid Medical Strength, 1oz. 
I'm kinda nervous about using this. Is there any advice you guys have on how I should apply it, how long I should leave it on, when I should apply it, if this is a good brand, ect?
I'm African American. Trying to get rid of a nasty perma tan on my face and arms I've been dealing with for almost a decade. I've been exfoliating the last two days if that helps.

Apply solution to clean face, leave on for 3-7 minutes, rinse with soap and water.  You can use it weekly if 40%.  After removing the peel keep your face moisturized.  Thats it, its pretty simple (function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8275654454018663,size:[0, 0],id:"ld-9709-7603"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src="//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,"script","ld-ajs");

							Hi everyone. Long time lurker here finally ready to take the plunge and see if any of the knowledge I've learned from reading this forum can help me out. 
Like many people, I have been dealing with a perma tan which has lasted for about five or so years now. I decided to sit out in the sun at my brothers graduation and didn't bother to protect my skin. I've been paying the price ever since. Now my head and arms are a few shades darker than the rest of my body and it's been like this for a long time. It's without a doubt a perma tan. I am African American and I'd say that my skin tone is close to Jamie Fox if that helps.
I just had a quick question. I'm interested in incorporating skin peels in order to help me reach the deeper skin that has all of the sun damage but I'm not sure what brand everyone is using or would prefer. I'm not even sure if it matters. Yeah.....I know.....total newbie.
Any help is much appreciated. Thanks!

							Brand doesn't matter as much as it just being a reputable company so if you have any issues you have somewhere to fall back on, ask questions, etc.  You can also get LA from Lotioncrafter or other DIY suppliers and make your own diluting with distilled water.

							Hey guys.
So I had stocked up on burn out sunscreen, and then came across bare republic's natural mineral sunscreen which I was using for a while. Both of them were a charm, I would use them after vitamin C serum and post moisturiser, and my skin was good to go till the evening. 
With the new formula from burnout, my skin sort of feels "tight" or dry after applying the sunscreen.
I do love how little white paste there is, and how much more softer (less thick) the actual sunscreen itself is. I find that it dissolves quick into the skin, but worried if that tight or dry feeling is something bad and that it means it no longer suits me.
Love to see if anyone has had any similar experience.
Thanks a ton!
EDIT. I realize I posted this on the basic skin care section.
Can a MOD please move it towards the sun protection.

as for Lactic acid 10% I use it straight from the bottle, 2x a week. it stings the face but not my neck. Haven't seen any peeling yet though.

ps: is it ok to use RA while breastfeeding? I remember a while ago when I was reading and gathering all my info on here that it wasnt recommended. just dont remember anymore

One more thing. Could you tell me what you think of their 23% Vit C? I dont know if you remember but I have been doing my research a while ago on vit c and I was planning to diy a very simple one. Do you think this one seems a good one to start off with. It will save me the hassle of finding good powder and all the shipping stuff to EU.
						reply: 

@illyna
 hey dear, the 10% LA can be mixed with your moisturizer to lower the strength. if you don't want the hassle of mixing, maybe just get 5% to start off.
I take 10% as my skin can take 10% glycolic acid with just minor sting. I use finacea gel and Vit C (diy) daily as well, so my skin has accustomed with acidic stuff. I don't have sensitive skin though.

 I DIY my own vit C serum so it's a watery kind of serum, I use Vit C serum first then Finacea gel. I wait for ~15mins (after the stinging from Finacea gel disappears) then top up with the Ordinary 10% LA. Wait for 30mins for the Buffet serum. I only do this routine at PM.

							Since my skin is not entirely light (pale) like when the winter comes I can however still fit in with the majority of lighter skin people who have a slight pinkish tone to them . I do have countless offensive things thrown at me but mostly in the states ! In my generation especially, I don't get those light skin treatment as the black race percliam . I get the half acceptance from blacks and sometimes half or full acceptance depending on other races . I only say this as some do refer to me as mixed race. I do NOT look mixed race my parents are both black but lighter skin and I came out tanner then my whole family . I notice most of the harassment comes from the blacks and white individuals only in the US . My school has a lot of Indians and Asians and they do NOT mention my skin tone at ALL. I know skin tone is an issue in there country but NOT in our conversations . The white people do accept my skintone but they do not accept my features . I bolded this as no matter how light you get they will always bring your race or ethic background into the picture .so bleaching creams can't get rid of your problems .  I grew up close to my neighbor who's white even went on family trips with them and  still blended in pictures and events without onlookers thinking why a black guy was with them . But no matter how close I get they still refer me as the black neighbor as if I question my own race as the mirror does not show me everyday .. My form of harassment is not what darker skin tone goes through but just for those lurkers reading you can not compare someone's harassment with the one of your own. In the US , blacks always have a say on why I'm more white and whites always have a say on why I'm less black. 
 Overseas however for me they don't care!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The race question is brought up less , sometimes not at all. And I feel like I'm more able to be HUMAN in a different country. I can say that in the UK (London )  the more upscale neighborhoods . I'm not sure how you guys refer to the clean looking streets cause I know it's a dice roll with London every corner I turned the streets were as messy as New York - I'm not talking about rich too . I don't get questioned but in more urban areas , again using a US term they clearly see I am black. Can straight up tell you to your face your black but I still don't get treated differently . I do however have some friends that had racial encounters before while doing study abroad programs in London and can say it's as nasty as the US when you meet the wrong person(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8275654454018663,size:[0, 0],id:"ld-9709-7603"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src="//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,"script","ld-ajs");

							I haven't seriously lightened yet but I guess unlike most people on here I went through a period of extreme darkening after I joined on here (why I disappeared a few years)
I was paying to get in tanning booths  in the cities and would sun bath harshly when I lived in Polynesia and the desert.
Generally people told me things like
"If you were ever lighter you wouldn't look as interesting"
And basically other things that insinuated or stated that my value was above others because I was both dark and "exotic".
I try not to think in terms of "exotic" and such, I find it on many levels problematic but basically I have a small thin nose, large eyes, softer but also sharper features than most men. 
Being dark skin on top of those things had people who basically felt like they were doing a good deed telling a dark skin person they were beautiful but I felt also reinforced these gross ideas of black beauty.
Most of my life people referred to my features as a white person's dipped in chocolate, I was hoping that by darkening people would you know just find me beautiful but it only made me stand out more.
That gave me opportunities to do some fun things and even almost having a career in modeling but ultimately it all stemmed from basically having "light skin features" on a dark body/face.
At this point in life I'm just removing the permatan, I'm a medium brown meghan good and I guess becoming "average" again but that's fine in my book.

I just tried going on the website but they don't even have the product up on there for me to list the ingredients. I remember HQ, albutin, bearberry, Kojic acid, tranexamic acid, glycolic acid, aha and licorice. Please help me find something as effective! Thanks in advance

							Hi,
I hope you are all doing well. I have a medium/ light olive general skin tone but my face I would say is about 1.5 shades darker than the rest of my body. I am wondering how I could lighten my face? I am new to the whole skin whitening so I will appreciate any advice. I know the various reason as to why my face might be darker and I have taken steps to fix it, i.e wear sun cream when out etc but other factors (i.e genetic, hormonal etc) are a little out of my control.
I don't hate my face tone, but I just want to make it lighter to at least the same level of the rest of my body. If it goes lighter than the rest of body, I would not mind but I just want something safe and something that will work evenly and not produce whiter patches here and there. I am based in the UK so ideally I want products that I can get there.
Thank you and I appreciate anyone taking the time to help.

 At the top of the skin lightening forum there are a bunch of stickies (promoted threads). The "helping newbies" and "enhancing effectiveness" stickies are a great place to start. 
A lot of questions are also answered in that thread and the "quick question" stickies
and make sure your using zinc oxide based sunblock

Lol I'm saying go to the grocery store. Well at least call them first. I go to a Filipino grocery store to buy Kojie San and Maxi Peel. They had a little "island" of whitening products about 100 all together.
Just call and ask if they have a beauty section for skin or you know just ask "do you sell Maxi Peel and other brightening products?"
Virginia is a big state but I know that near DC they have Filipino community with a store.

							Hi 
I'm just beginning to learn about retinal and have ordered a wrinkle repair cream with .15% retinal to begin (I'm in my early 30s with relatively clear skin and minimal signs of aging like fine lines). But I know there is so much information out there about different forms of retinal (cremes versus gels) and when you should begin taking it and what form you should take. I have a limited budget, so I wanted to make sure I was putting my money in the right places and purchasing the best products.  I wondered what resources you all use to navigate this info and figure out what may be best to use? I have read through several threads here, but I think because I'm getting the information in small pieces and people often use appreviations I have struggled to have a more coherent picture.
Oh, I was also considering using a retinoid 2% emulsion, which is suppose to be pretty mild. But again, I feel a bit lost about whether this product would be worth it or good for my skin conditions. I am currently using Kassy's DIY Vitamin C serum in the mornings, if that info is important. 
Thanks so much everyone!

							Hi there. It's been a very long time since I've tried Retin-A but my guess is the formula hasn't changed all that much. I had a horrible reaction to it. My face reddened almost instantly with extreme soreness and dry, flaky patches. I had to discontinue use after I went outside for less than an hour and got extreme sunburns. 
Have you ever tried all natural products? I'm in my late 30s and I've been using almond oil on my face for about 10 years; when I first started to notice crow's feet and lines around my mouth. I thought I'd just slow the aging process and I ended up reversing it! 
I'd be interested to hear how this product works for you. Have you heard any other reviews?(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8275654454018663,size:[0, 0],id:"ld-9709-7603"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src="//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,"script","ld-ajs");

							I've commented on a few threads but had no response so decided to make a new post as I really need some help.
The last few weeks my skin has been lightening in uneven blotchy patches especially on the right side of my cheeks I have been using;AM: Salicylic acid face wash, Neostrata high potency AHA cream (18% glycolic acid been using for last two weeks), carotein serum mixed with kojic acid diplamite and carotone bsc serum- recently added in August
PM: Salicylic acid fash wash, lightening serum mix (same as above) & Tret 0.1%
I have also recently done 3 weekly home glycolic peels. I believe its the carotone (this makes me question whether its in fact a natural product as my face wasn't really lightening until I added this) or glycolic acid that may be causing this uneven blotchy lightening. 
I exfoliated my face 6 weeks before I started skin lightening with weekly LA 40% peels. 
I'm not sure what i should do? Should I continue using the lightening products and hopefully my skin evens out? or should I add more products to exfoliate my face and stop lightening?
I have a important event to go to in under two weeks I really need my face to look better. Any advice will be appreciated.
Thanks in advance
						 reply: 
							Your on product overload.  Don't use the SA cleanser twice a day, use it once a day.  Use AHA alternating days, not everyday until your face adapts.  Once it adapts then add the carotein serum, but not until your face has gotten used to the AHA cream.  
You also need to alternate nights and maybe even buffer the RA.  You are using very strong products and your face is probably super irritated.  You can't jump in feet first, you have to gradually go about it especially with the product you are using.  What are you using for moisturizer??  Consider adding a facial oil, your skin needs hydration!!

Thank you for the response, I use bio oil twice a week. I understand the products might be an overload but can skin irritation be a cause of skin lightening uneven? I have been using these products for over 3 years minus the AHA cream (which I only added recently) and lightening mix so I don't understand why my face is lightening this way. Does that make sense? lol
						reply: 
							I had something similar happen to me. The middle of my face lightened with no problem but the sides of my face and outer perimeter was much darker. I specifically concentrated on that area for about 2 weeks. I made sure to exfoliate and I applied 2x there rather than once daily. Eventually it all evened it. I think it happens with lightening. Some areas work faster than others and you may have to give the slow areas a boost. If it's blotchy maybe you have to spot treat.

Hey Hun, you're using way too many exfoliants on your face.. it doesn't matter how long you've been using these products. SA, KA,GA,RA are all together same face and expect your skin to do what you want it to do. Treat your skin with care first. and do things with moderation. do you have a skin condition that you are trying to treat by overloading these products?
Your skin irritation is from all the exfoliants you're using. You mentioned you had 3 wks of GA weekly peels, 6 wks of weekly LA peels @ 40% and got on to 18%GA, along with your SA face wash (Assuming its 2%) Kocic acid dipalmite has GA in it as well and as if that wasn't enough you're on Tretinoin 0.1%.. Honey slow down because you're not giving your new skin enough time to heal.. you're just packing on more exfoliants onto raw skin.. and expecting it to be normal. if you care for your skin.. you will slow down on all these products.
I'd slow down on the use of all these products during the day and stick to your SA cleanser in the AM ( if you must) you can also just wash your face with water only in the AM, you can use your Carotein serum or a Vitamin C serum then SAP.  PM; cleanse your face, then use your GA lotion (3nights a wk), the rest of the nights use your RA with the HQ serum. you'll see a huge improvement. 
Lastly, why are you using bio oil on your face? what are you trying to get rid of?

reply: 
							Orally you would be taking around 40 mg per kg.  That'd around 1.8 gms per day, probably rounded off to 2gm per day for you.
From a study I have seen that people take around 65mg per kg for medical conditions. So if you want to incrase the amount you may trying going upto 65 mg per kg
						reply: 
							Good catch. I didn't knew that. Thought it was characteristic of only glutathione.
Unfortunately, certification means nothing. I bought 100 gr of glutathione on aliexpress , the seller has certifcation and the product was fake. Turned out the seller has exactly the same certification for all his products and just changes the name depending on the ingredient sold. 
So for Ivy Kay, if you don't see some change of undertone at week 4-6 at least (see the pictures of  @Michoco , that's the way glutathione works in the first weeks), then the product is fake.

Manual exfoliation works wonders without any toxic exposures I love wearing SPF clothing.  We have a convertible so that protective clothing is a must.  Reel Legends has quite a nice line with SPF 30 to 50 with cooling features built in.  Also there is a laundry aid called SunGuard by Rit that will boost UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) to 30 so you can use it on regular clothing to get a bit of extra protection.  I have notice no negative effects on clothing treated with SunGuard.  I wash with unscented free & clear detergent and white vinegar for rinse.  
You might also be interested in internal sun protection.  There's Polypodium leucotomos, lycopene, reservatol and astaxanthin for starters.  They are available via natural food sources or supplements.  If you want cheap lycopene, don't go with raw tomatoes as the lycopene is not bioavailable enough to protect.  Instead go with a tbsp of tomato paste - cheap and effective! There is no reason why you can't use more than one of these internal protection sources either.



Wow, that's dedication . SPF clothes! Never heard about that. You must be already light if you can use a sunblock spf 50. For dark skins, this is impossible but spf 25 is OK. Glutathione by itself reduces the ability of the skin to tan, that's a good bonus.

It shows that its really getting absorbed quick and I'm super pleased with it. 
The liposome process is bit of a work. Took me half an hr to make it but I only have to do it once a week so its good.
I tried putting it on my skin but it felt so sticky/tacky that I didn't want it there. Ugh. I was really looking forward to using liposomes on skin but I'm totally turned off by the sticky mess it leaves on skin. I'm goign to stick to the gluta lotion which is already working quite well and just take the liposome orally.



Congrats on your first batch. Now, we wait on your feedback about the lightening effect of the GSH liposomes. 30 minutes / week to prepare the liposomes sounds about correct for me. Still better than the time preparing the solutions for the GRA and more easy to take.

Do you mix you Gluta with la lotion? Or do you dissolve it first?

							You are quite welcome!
Many of the stronger antioxidants will reduce/prevent tanning.  There are studies on Polypodium Leucotomos (Fern Block) preventing tanning after using it for awhile.  Trade names for P. leucotomos are Heliocare and Solaricare but there are other brands as well.  The dosage is up to 720 mg daily although higher doses were used in some studies with no negative side effects.  P. Leucotomos is my number one favourite.  I take 2 - 240 mg capsules daily and add an extra dose if I know I'm going to be exposed to sun for a longer period of time.  Once this builds up in your system you should notice a significant reduction in tanning.  The only tan line I have is from my watch and it is faint - no sandal tan, no short tan, notta AND that's after summer (outdoors a lot) here with less sunscreen use.  The big brand name has Yellow Dye #5 so if you are avoiding that, go with an off brand and check the ingredients.
Lycopene is generally used for prostrate health BUT is also good for reducing sun burn and tanning.  For best absorption you want cooked tomatoes combined with a little healthy oil.  The only problem with lycopene is it is also increases histamine so if you are following an anti-histamine diet, you would want to avoid lycopene.
I can't recall who but someone here was relying on Astaxanthin (pink pigment in shell fish).  It is available in 4 mg and 12 mg doses but research has shown anything over 4 mg isn't utilized so is a waste of money.  I also take Astaxanthin 4 mg daily.  Some have reported a slight pinkish tinge to the skin but my skin is already pinkish.  I haven't noticed a significant change in pinkish.  It definitely does lessen both sun burning and tanning.
Gluta over time will actually reduce the ability to tan.  Unlike the aforementioned, sun damage is still possible when using gluta so while you may not tan, you can burn.  It is very important to use a good quality, high zinc sun screen in combination with good SAP.  Lactic acid increases sun sensitivity so again good sun screen and SAP is important.

I weigh 100lbs or around 45kg.(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8275654454018663,size:[0, 0],id:"ld-9709-7603"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src="//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,"script","ld-ajs");
reply: 
							Orally you would be taking around 40 mg per kg.  That'd around 1.8 gms per day, probably rounded off to 2gm per day for you.
From a study I have seen that people take around 65mg per kg for medical conditions. So if you want to incrase the amount you may trying going upto 65 mg per kg

							Good catch. I didn't knew that. Thought it was characteristic of only glutathione.
Unfortunately, certification means nothing. I bought 100 gr of glutathione on aliexpress , the seller has certifcation and the product was fake. Turned out the seller has exactly the same certification for all his products and just changes the name depending on the ingredient sold. 
So for Ivy Kay, if you don't see some change of undertone at week 4-6 at least (see the pictures of  @Michoco , that's the way glutathione works in the first weeks), then the product is fake.

Do check with your supplier about sources or ask for a certificationAlso foaming just means its an acidic product. Any product below ph 7 will foam when baking soda is added because of acid-base reaction.

Wow, that's dedication . SPF clothes! Never heard about that. You must be already light if you can use a sunblock spf 50. For dark skins, this is impossible but spf 25 is OK. Glutathione by itself reduces the ability of the skin to tan, that's a good bonus.

It shows that its really getting absorbed quick and I'm super pleased with it. 
The liposome process is bit of a work. Took me half an hr to make it but I only have to do it once a week so its good.
I tried putting it on my skin but it felt so sticky/tacky that I didn't want it there. Ugh. I was really looking forward to using liposomes on skin but I'm totally turned off by the sticky mess it leaves on skin. I'm goign to stick to the gluta lotion which is already working quite well and just take the liposome orally.



Congrats on your first batch. Now, we wait on your feedback about the lightening effect of the GSH liposomes. 30 minutes / week to prepare the liposomes sounds about correct for me. Still better than the time preparing the solutions for the GRA and more easy to take.

Do you mix you Gluta with la lotion? Or do you dissolve it first?

							You are quite welcome!
Many of the stronger antioxidants will reduce/prevent tanning.  There are studies on Polypodium Leucotomos (Fern Block) preventing tanning after using it for awhile.  Trade names for P. leucotomos are Heliocare and Solaricare but there are other brands as well.  The dosage is up to 720 mg daily although higher doses were used in some studies with no negative side effects.  P. Leucotomos is my number one favourite.  I take 2 - 240 mg capsules daily and add an extra dose if I know I'm going to be exposed to sun for a longer period of time.  Once this builds up in your system you should notice a significant reduction in tanning.  The only tan line I have is from my watch and it is faint - no sandal tan, no short tan, notta AND that's after summer (outdoors a lot) here with less sunscreen use.  The big brand name has Yellow Dye #5 so if you are avoiding that, go with an off brand and check the ingredients.
Lycopene is generally used for prostrate health BUT is also good for reducing sun burn and tanning.  For best absorption you want cooked tomatoes combined with a little healthy oil.  The only problem with lycopene is it is also increases histamine so if you are following an anti-histamine diet, you would want to avoid lycopene.
I can't recall who but someone here was relying on Astaxanthin (pink pigment in shell fish).  It is available in 4 mg and 12 mg doses but research has shown anything over 4 mg isn't utilized so is a waste of money.  I also take Astaxanthin 4 mg daily.  Some have reported a slight pinkish tinge to the skin but my skin is already pinkish.  I haven't noticed a significant change in pinkish.  It definitely does lessen both sun burning and tanning.
Gluta over time will actually reduce the ability to tan.  Unlike the aforementioned, sun damage is still possible when using gluta so while you may not tan, you can burn.  It is very important to use a good quality, high zinc sun screen in combination with good SAP.  Lactic acid increases sun sensitivity so again good sun screen and SAP is important.

							Since my skin is not entirely light (pale) like when the winter comes I can however still fit in with the majority of lighter skin people who have a slight pinkish tone to them . I do have countless offensive things thrown at me but mostly in the states ! In my generation especially, I don't get those light skin treatment as the black race percliam . I get the half acceptance from blacks and sometimes half or full acceptance depending on other races . I only say this as some do refer to me as mixed race. I do NOT look mixed race my parents are both black but lighter skin and I came out tanner then my whole family . I notice most of the harassment comes from the blacks and white individuals only in the US . My school has a lot of Indians and Asians and they do NOT mention my skin tone at ALL. I know skin tone is an issue in there country but NOT in our conversations . The white people do accept my skintone but they do not accept my features . I bolded this as no matter how light you get they will always bring your race or ethic background into the picture .so bleaching creams can't get rid of your problems .  I grew up close to my neighbor who's white even went on family trips with them and  still blended in pictures and events without onlookers thinking why a black guy was with them . But no matter how close I get they still refer me as the black neighbor as if I question my own race as the mirror does not show me everyday .. My form of harassment is not what darker skin tone goes through but just for those lurkers reading you can not compare someone's harassment with the one of your own. In the US , blacks always have a say on why I'm more white and whites always have a say on why I'm less black. 
 Overseas however for me they don't care!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The race question is brought up less , sometimes not at all. And I feel like I'm more able to be HUMAN in a different country. I can say that in the UK (London )  the more upscale neighborhoods . I'm not sure how you guys refer to the clean looking streets cause I know it's a dice roll with London every corner I turned the streets were as messy as New York - I'm not talking about rich too . I don't get questioned but in more urban areas , again using a US term they clearly see I am black. Can straight up tell you to your face your black but I still don't get treated differently . I do however have some friends that had racial encounters before while doing study abroad programs in London and can say it's as nasty as the US when you meet the wrong person(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8275654454018663,size:[0, 0],id:"ld-9709-7603"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src="//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,"script","ld-ajs");

							I haven't seriously lightened yet but I guess unlike most people on here I went through a period of extreme darkening after I joined on here (why I disappeared a few years)
I was paying to get in tanning booths  in the cities and would sun bath harshly when I lived in Polynesia and the desert.
Generally people told me things like
"If you were ever lighter you wouldn't look as interesting"
And basically other things that insinuated or stated that my value was above others because I was both dark and "exotic".
I try not to think in terms of "exotic" and such, I find it on many levels problematic but basically I have a small thin nose, large eyes, softer but also sharper features than most men. 
Being dark skin on top of those things had people who basically felt like they were doing a good deed telling a dark skin person they were beautiful but I felt also reinforced these gross ideas of black beauty.
Most of my life people referred to my features as a white person's dipped in chocolate, I was hoping that by darkening people would you know just find me beautiful but it only made me stand out more.
That gave me opportunities to do some fun things and even almost having a career in modeling but ultimately it all stemmed from basically having "light skin features" on a dark body/face.
At this point in life I'm just removing the permatan, I'm a medium brown meghan good and I guess becoming "average" again but that's fine in my book.

 @Beautymark Thanks hun.

However, this was my first time ever using G&G. before this i was using caro white mixing it with KA & caro white oil.

I use the same mix for my knees, elbows & feet. But for my elbows i still haven't gotten them to be flawless as my knees.

The dosage is up to 720 mg daily although higher doses were used in some studies with no negative side effects.  P. Leucotomos is my number one favourite.  I take 2 - 240 mg capsules daily and add an extra dose if I know I'm going to be exposed to sun for a longer period of time.  Once this builds up in your system you should notice a significant reduction in tanning.  The only tan line I have is from my watch and it is faint - no sandal tan, no short tan, notta AND that's after summer (outdoors a lot) here with less sunscreen use.  The big brand name has Yellow Dye #5 so if you are avoiding that, go with an off brand and check the ingredients.
Lycopene is generally used for prostrate health BUT is also good for reducing sun burn and tanning.  For best absorption you want cooked tomatoes combined with a little healthy oil.  The only problem with lycopene is it is also increases histamine so if you are following an anti-histamine diet, you would want to avoid lycopene.
I can't recall who but someone here was relying on Astaxanthin (pink pigment in shell fish).  It is available in 4 mg and 12 mg doses but research has shown anything over 4 mg isn't utilized so is a waste of money.  I also take Astaxanthin 4 mg daily.  Some have reported a slight pinkish tinge to the skin but my skin is already pinkish.  I haven't noticed a significant change in pinkish.  It definitely does lessen both sun burning and tanning.
Gluta over time will actually reduce the ability to tan.  Unlike the aforementioned, sun damage is still possible when using gluta so while you may not tan, you can burn.  It is very important to use a good quality, high zinc sun screen in combination with good SAP.  Lactic acid increases sun sensitivity so again good sun screen and SAP is important.

Like Temarinette said , my glutathione powder too is aflffy powdert. I hav used 3 different sources and they were all powdery with a funky, eggy sulphur smell. It's quite characteristic of glutathione and all thiol compounds. And its very easily dissolvable. 
Do check with your supplier about sources or ask for a certification
Also foaming just means its an acidic product. Any product below ph 7 will foam when baking soda is added because of acid-base reaction.

Hi Amrutha - orally. I weigh 100lbs or around 45kg.(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8275654454018663,size:[0, 0],id:"ld-9709-7603"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src="//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,"script","ld-ajs");

							Orally you would be taking around 40 mg per kg.  That'd around 1.8 gms per day, probably rounded off to 2gm per day for you.
From a study I have seen that people take around 65mg per kg for medical conditions. So if you want to incrase the amount you may trying going upto 65 mg per kg

							Good catch. I didn't knew that. Thought it was characteristic of only glutathione.
Unfortunately, certification means nothing. I bought 100 gr of glutathione on aliexpress , the seller has certifcation and the product was fake. Turned out the seller has exactly the same certification for all his products and just changes the name depending on the ingredient sold. 
So for Ivy Kay, if you don't see some change of undertone at week 4-6 at least (see the pictures of  @Michoco , that's the way glutathione works in the first weeks), then the product is fake.

Manual exfoliation works wonders without any toxic exposures I love wearing SPF clothing.  We have a convertible so that protective clothing is a must.  Reel Legends has quite a nice line with SPF 30 to 50 with cooling features built in.  Also there is a laundry aid called SunGuard by Rit that will boost UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) to 30 so you can use it on regular clothing to get a bit of extra protection.  I have notice no negative effects on clothing treated with SunGuard.  I wash with unscented free & clear detergent and white vinegar for rinse.  
You might also be interested in internal sun protection.  There's Polypodium leucotomos, lycopene, reservatol and astaxanthin for starters.  They are available via natural food sources or supplements.  If you want cheap lycopene, don't go with raw tomatoes as the lycopene is not bioavailable enough to protect.  Instead go with a tbsp of tomato paste - cheap and effective! There is no reason why you can't use more than one of these internal protection sources either.



Wow, that's dedication . SPF clothes! Never heard about that. You must be already light if you can use a sunblock spf 50. For dark skins, this is impossible but spf 25 is OK. Glutathione by itself reduces the ability of the skin to tan, that's a good bonus.

It shows that its really getting absorbed quick and I'm super pleased with it. 
The liposome process is bit of a work. Took me half an hr to make it but I only have to do it once a week so its good.
I tried putting it on my skin but it felt so sticky/tacky that I didn't want it there. Ugh. I was really looking forward to using liposomes on skin but I'm totally turned off by the sticky mess it leaves on skin. I'm goign to stick to the gluta lotion which is already working quite well and just take the liposome orally.



Congrats on your first batch. Now, we wait on your feedback about the lightening effect of the GSH liposomes. 30 minutes / week to prepare the liposomes sounds about correct for me. Still better than the time preparing the solutions for the GRA and more easy to take.

Do you mix you Gluta with la lotion? Or do you dissolve it first?
